Checking if the launcher JVM can be re-used for build. To be re-used, the launcher JVM needs to match the parameters required for the build process: -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1g -XX:+UseG1GC --add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.lang.invoke=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.prefs/java.util.prefs=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.net=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.util.concurrent.atomic=ALL-UNNAMED -Xmx6g -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Duser.country=US -Duser.language=en -Duser.variant
To honour the JVM settings for this build a single-use Daemon process will be forked. See https://docs.gradle.org/8.1.1/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon.

Successfully started process 'Gradle build daemon'
An attempt to start the daemon took 1.025 secs.
The client will now receive all logging from the daemon (pid: 643). The daemon log file: /tmp/.gradle/daemon/8.1.1/daemon-643.out.log
Closing daemon's stdin at end of input.
The daemon will no longer process any standard input.
Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build

Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 9.0.

You can use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings and determine if they come from your own scripts or plugins.

See https://docs.gradle.org/8.1.1/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_warnings

BUILD FAILED in 11s
Some of the file system contents retained in the virtual file system are on file systems that Gradle doesn't support watching. The relevant state was discarded to ensure changes to these locations are properly detected. You can override this by explicitly enabling file system watching.
